=====================================================

1. Foundations of System Design
Basic Concepts:

What is System Design?: System design refers to the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It's crucial for ensuring that the system can handle the expected workload, meet business requirements, and scale as needed.
Importance: Understanding system design is critical for creating systems that are robust, scalable, and maintainable. It's essential in product-based companies where systems need to handle millions of users and massive amounts of data efficiently.
Scalability:

Horizontal Scaling: Adding more machines/servers to distribute the load. This is typically preferred for large-scale systems as it allows for nearly infinite scaling.
Vertical Scaling: Increasing the power of existing machines by adding more resources (CPU, RAM). This has a limit and can be more expensive.
Importance: Choosing the right scaling strategy is crucial for maintaining system performance as user demand grows.
Reliability:

Fault Tolerance: The ability of a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components.
Replication: Keeping multiple copies of data across different servers to ensure data availability even in case of a failure.
Data Backups: Regularly saving data to prevent loss in case of a catastrophic event.
Importance: Reliability ensures that systems can continue to operate smoothly even when components fail, which is critical for maintaining user trust and business continuity.
Availability:

High Availability: Ensuring that a system is operational and accessible for the maximum possible time. This often involves using redundancy and failover strategies.
Disaster Recovery: Strategies for recovering from catastrophic failures, such as data center outages, through backups and failover sites.
Failover Strategies: Automatically switching to a standby system when the main system fails to ensure continuity.
Importance: High availability and disaster recovery are essential for maintaining service continuity, especially for systems that require 24/7 uptime.
2. Networking Basics
IP Addressing and Subnetting:

IP Addressing: Understanding IPv4 and IPv6, public vs. private IPs, and how IP addresses are used in networking.
Subnetting: Dividing an IP address space into smaller, more manageable segments.
Importance: Networking is fundamental to system design, as it affects how components communicate within a system and with external systems.
Load Balancing:

Types:
DNS-based: Distributing traffic based on DNS queries.
Hardware Load Balancers: Dedicated devices that manage and distribute network or application traffic.
Software Load Balancers: Software applications that manage traffic (e.g., HAProxy, NGINX).
Algorithms:
Round Robin: Distributes requests evenly across servers.
Least Connections: Sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
Importance: Load balancing is essential for distributing traffic efficiently across servers, ensuring reliability and scalability.
CDNs (Content Delivery Networks):

How They Work: CDNs store copies of data (like images, videos) in multiple locations (nodes) around the world to deliver content to users from the nearest node.
Caching Strategies: Techniques to store copies of content in multiple places to reduce latency and server load.
Importance: CDNs improve the user experience by reducing latency and ensuring faster content delivery, which is critical for high-traffic websites and applications.
DNS (Domain Name System):

How DNS Works: Converts human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.
Importance: DNS is a fundamental component of the internet, and understanding it is crucial for designing systems that are accessible and reliable.
3. System Design Patterns
Microservices vs. Monoliths:

Monolithic Architecture: A single, unified application where all components are tightly coupled.
Microservices Architecture: A system where different functionalities are separated into independent services that communicate over a network.
Pros and Cons: Microservices allow for easier scaling and independent deployment, but add complexity in terms of service coordination and management.
Importance: Choosing between monolithic and microservices architecture affects scalability, maintainability, and the ability to deploy new features.
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):

SOA Basics: Similar to microservices but typically involves more heavyweight protocols like SOAP.
Importance: SOA is foundational for understanding how services can be designed to communicate across a network, often in enterprise environments.
